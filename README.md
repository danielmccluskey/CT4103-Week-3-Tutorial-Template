# CT4103 - Week 3 - Tutorial
Welcome to your third tutorial repository for CT4103 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence! This is your own personal repository where you and only you can see and make changes.

We will be using GitHub Classrooms for most tutorials and Assignment submissions during this module, so it might be a good idea to brush up on your Git skills in your independant learning hours.

Below are a list of tutorials, these are not assessed but you are expected to complete each of them either in the practical session of the lecture or in your own time, they may seem simple, but they focus on building your skills from the ground up and will teach you the skills which the Assignments for this module are marked upon.

This repository contains a quick tutorial that will go over how to setup Git on the command line, how to import this tutorial repository using the command line, and some basic Python Exercises.

## Tutorials
List of tutorials for this session:

1. [Using GitHub on the Command Line](CT4103-Week-3-Tutorial-1-UsingGit.md)
2. [Python Exercises](CT4103-Week-3-Tutorial-2-PythonExercises.md)
3. [Using Git to commit your work on the Command Line](CT4103-Week-3-Tutorial-3-CommittingYourWork.md)

## Extra Resources
### Helpful Links

##### GitHub Tutorials
We will be teaching you how to use Git and GitHub later in the module but its a good idea to try and get a grasp of it on your own since you will also be using it for other modules. Git is also industry standard in most companies for Source Control so being proficient at it is a must for being hired during your placement year or after your course.
